# XMR-Balance-Checker

A very simple shell script which uses the monero-wallet-cli to check the balances of all your monero wallets.
Optionally, refresh each wallet balance by removing the commented out lines in the script. (required if your restoring wallets or think the balance has changed since last opening.)


# Why?

If you have lots of different monero wallets and do not wish to open each one individually.
If you want to restore lots of monero wallets and do not wish to open each one individually.
